"""
my_array = [10 20 30]

1. elements of an array are not separated by a comma
2. Only same type of data can be stored
3. They are faster (occupy less memory)
4. They are containers that can hold fixed number of items
5. n-dimensional arrays can be created

All the elements of an array are stored in the consecutive blocks in the memory
while elements of a List are stored in different blocks anywhere in the memory

-----------------------
List vs Arrays
if I do [10, 20, 30]*2 then list will be repeated twice i.e. math operations 
dont work
But in arrays, we can perform operations easily

-------------
type(arr) = numpy.ndarray
